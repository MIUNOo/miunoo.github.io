    <p>Hello, my name is  <strong><em>Chenjie Zhang</em></strong>. I&rsquo;m a graduate student at the <em><strong>University of Southern California</strong></em>, starting in the fall of 2024, majoring in <em><strong>Computer Science - Game Development</strong></em>. I have experience with <em><strong>Unity</strong></em> and <em><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></em>, and I have built several projects using these game engines.</p>
<p>When participating in game jams, I like to use the code name <em><strong>“MIUNO”</strong></em>. This name, pronounced <em>[ˈmjuːno]</em>, is inspired by the code name <em>MONA</em> from <em>Persona 5</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My experience in game development originated from my childhood. (OLD STORY) Like many other kids, I enjoyed playing video games. As the years passed, I found myself obsessed with computer softwares. I made a hobby of exploring professional software and making small stuffs, even though I knew very little about them at the time. This obsession led me to discover a new skill: creating promotional videos(PV) for music. I made a few PVs just for practices and gradually decided to try making video games when I grew up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I believe game development and software development could be very customized in the near future. One can develop for their own needs, and the learning process won&rsquo;t be hard and long. This means people&rsquo;s ideas could become reality and ready for use in a short time. I would like to spread my ideas to the world and also build a world that helps others to share their thoughts.</p>
<p>Now, with a long-term goal in mind, I have finally acquired some skills in game development. I&rsquo;m currently learning computer graphics and how to develop a small game engine using C++.</p>
